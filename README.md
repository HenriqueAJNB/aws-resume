# 📄 My personal AWS resume ☁️

## 👨‍💻 About me

Hey there! 👋 I'm Henrique Branco, a machine learning engineer passionate about software, cloud computing and serverless architecture.

## 🏗️ Project overview

This project showcases not just my resume, but also my hands-on experience with AWS services. It implements a static HTML resume website containing my resume with a dynamic visitor counter. Every time someone click on the resume webpage, a JavaScript function triggers an AWS API Gateway endpoint, which invokes a Lambda function to increment a counter stored in DynamoDB. Then, the webpage is upated to display that information.

Are you curious about the project's documentation and architecture or how it was designed? Check it [here](./docs/README.md)!
